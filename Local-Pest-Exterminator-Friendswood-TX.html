<p>A wildlife control operator (WCO) is an expert trapper certified by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) to charge a fee for handling problem wildlife issues. Termites eat furnishings, documents, books, and even documents kept in safes and lockers, thus triggering enormous damage within simply a couple of months. This stops the pest acquiring resistance to chemicals produced by the plant or used to the crops. Exterminators go to client houses and businesses to inspect for insects or rodents.
