<p>Unfortunately, the higher Tampa Bay location is home to plenty of spiders, and you have likely encountered them inside your house. Consider alternative techniques (besides pesticides) to make your home and garden unappealing to pests. With IPM, you act to keep pests from becoming a problem, such as by growing a healthy crop that can hold up against pest attacks, using disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from going into a building. Current missions for reliable, safe, and enduring pest management programs have actually been targeted mostly toward advancement of brand-new and better products with which to replace conventional harmful pesticides.</p>
