The following example explains the 6 components of an Integrated Pest Management program used to handle carpenter ants. Focusing mainly on long-term pest avoidance, an effective IPM program uses a combination of control approaches including biological control, habitat manipulation, changes to cultural practices and use of resistant plant ranges.</p>
<p>The determination of the correct reason for pest issue (understanding pest biology) and ecology is important in manipulating the environment to the crop's benefit and to the detriment of the pest. Insecticides harmful to many insects (broad-spectrum) will more adversely affect natural opponents than materials that are narrow-spectrum or selective for particular insect types or life phases. </p>
