<p>It utilizes a combination of practices and control approaches with the goal of avoiding problems from minimizing the need and occurring for pesticide extensive activities such as broadacre spraying. Likewise, consider policies and treatments that may unknowingly present pests: storage practices and equipment, maintenance, and housekeeping practices.
