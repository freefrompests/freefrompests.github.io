<p>Pest Management fact sheets Information on arthropod pest abundance, location within the greenhouse, and population trends (increases, decreases, or stable) aid figure out the efficiency of pest management methods. IPM techniques consist of the intro of predators and specific parasitoids (species of wasps that are internal parasites of other insects). The generic term pesticides" can apply to a wide spectrum of chemicals, including insecticides, rodenticides, herbicides, fungicides, biocides, and similar chemicals.</p>
<p>This in turn prevents weak plants which are more susceptible to pests and illness. Pest control measures may be performed as part of an incorporated pest management method.

A few of these aspects are intrinsic to crop production while making the environment less beneficial for survival, development and reproduction of pest species.</p>

Insecticides harmful to most insects (broad-spectrum) will more negatively affect natural enemies than materials that are selective or narrow-spectrum for specific insect species or life stages. </p>
