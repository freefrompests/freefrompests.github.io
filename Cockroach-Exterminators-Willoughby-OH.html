<p>Pest Management fact sheets Information on arthropod pest abundance, location within the greenhouse, and population trends (increases, decreases, or stable) aid figure out the efficiency of pest management methods. IPM techniques consist of the intro of predators and specific parasitoids (species of wasps that are internal parasites of other insects).

<p>This in turn prevents weak plants which are more susceptible to pests and illness. Pest control measures may be performed as part of an incorporated pest management method.
